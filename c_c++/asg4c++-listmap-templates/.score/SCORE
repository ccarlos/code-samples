Copy all of the files in this directory into the student's
directory.  For each point deduction, give a reason.  Numbers in
parens are the max points for each check.

Check to see if they are working alone or doing pair
programming.  If pair programming, they should have a symlink to
their partner's directory.  If it is not there, you should make
one.

Make sure PARTNER is a symlink, not a file.  Example: charles
and ada are working together.
. dir charles/ should have a symlink PARTNER -> ../ada
. dir ada/ should have a symlink PARTNER -> ../charles

Grade only one partner's code and assign them the same score.

SOURCE CODE.

     Run mk.build

     (3) Checksource was silent, did not complain.  No extra
	 files were submitted, except as per asgt spec.
         C++ source are all called .h or .cc as appropriate.

     (3) Used good consistent indentation.  Did not use any
	 one-letter idents, used only meaningful idents.

     (3) Used comparex, parix, testcmpx in code, and did not
         use anything prohibited from the STL.

     (3) main.cc handles files correctly.  Does options analysis

     (3) General good organization of classes other than lilstmap.

     The most significant work was building lilstmap.

     (3) General good appearance and implementation of lilstmap.

     (3) good code for lilstmap::put

     (3) good code for lilstmap::find

     (3) lilstmap::iterator::erase

     (3) lilstmap::iterator::operator++ 

source points: /30
min 1, max 30

PROGRAM TESTING:

     (3) If gmake failed, try to compile manually with:
         CC -g -features=extensions -o ydc *.cc
         If that worked, deduct these three 3 points.
         If not, assign 0 for this section.
         If gmake succeeded in building keyvalue, keep these 3 points.

     Run mk.tests

     (3) The test bcheck -leaks showed no memory leaks.

     Look at the other tests and check output for correctness.
     Each should work in the same way as pkeyvalue.perl

     (3) run1.stdin

     (3) run2.stdin

     (3) run3.files

     (3) run4.files

     (3) run5.files

     (3) run6.files

     (3) run7.nofiles

     Unix correctness:

     (3) was the exit status 0 for good tests and non-0 for bad?
         were error messages sent to stderr (cerr)?

     subtotal = /30 (max 30).

     If there were no core dumps during testing, or if the
     subtotal is less than 24, transfer this subtotal to the
     line below.  If there were any core dumps, the maximum
     testing points here will be 24.

testing points: /30
min 0, max 30.

The files refer to the perl generated files by Mackey,
and those created by my draw program.

Polygon.ps prints out the second rectangle two times,
However I compare the files under vim and both
are nearly identical except some spacing.

Square.ps prints off center,
However I compare the file under vim and both
are nearly identical except some spacing.

The Above is same with Pythagoras.ps

The escaping of parens or \ 
is not working for drawing text to ps files.
